 A new author is in the process of negotiating a contract for a new romance
novel. The publisher is offering three options. In the first option, the author
is paid $5,000 upon delivery of the final manuscript and $20,000 when the
novel is published.

In the second option, the author is paid 12.5% of the net
price of the novel for each copy of the novel sold. In the third option, the
author is paid 10% of the net price for the first 4000 copies sold, and 14% of
the net price for the copies sold over 4000. The author has some idea about
the number of copies that will be sold and would like to have an estimate of
the royalties generated under each option.

Write a program that prompts the author to enter the net price of each copy of the novel and the estimated
number of copies that will be sold. The program then outputs the royalties under each option and the best
option the author could choose.

(Use appropriate named constants to store the special values such as royalties rates and fixed royalties.)
